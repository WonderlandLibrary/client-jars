[27/09/2020 - Release 1.7]
- Improved Hypixel disabler to make Flight module bypass again, works up 2.1+ with consistency with boost mode 2
- Improved Flight module to work in latest Cubecraft server, 50 blocks max
- Improved Panel type click gui look, a color picker would be nice (soon)
- Improved Lowhop and Mineplex speed modes to work better

- Added BountyHunter option for AutoHypixel module, works with ESP, Nametags, OnRadarScreen and Tracers
- Added Exposed (show blocks that are exposed to air or semi-transparent block) option to Xray module
- Added Compensate (sets your Y level to a legit block height) option to Flight module
- Added "reset" option to .clientname command to change the name back to the previous
- Added "clear" option and the ability to add aliases with .friend command
- Added OnDamage modes (Disable, Update and Stay) option to Blink module
- Added DamageIndicators option for HUD module 

- Fixed account manager screen displaying the file chooser behind the Minecraft window
- Fixed Scaffold module bug in which sometimes it would expand while towering
- Fixed Flight to pick up on the damage once the blink stops
- Fixed Killsults file not saving properly

- Re-made the alt manager, proxy and the altening screen
- Re-made the file system, shouldn't cause weird crashes for some people
- Re-made the command system because the previous was much more limited (expecting suggestions)

Notes:
[] Your friends are now saved in a Friends.json file
[] Killsults and Accounts file type changed from .json to .txt for simpler use
[] Panel type click gui's options, position and open state get saved in Panels.json
[] Reminder, CivBreak module works on Hypixel. You can break blocks from any distance, nice for BedWars
[] Reminder, Accounts.txt format depends on the parts per line it has (each part separated by ":"):
     - One part will be accepted as an username (cracked account). If the part contains "@" it will be invalid and not added to the list
     - Two parts will be accepted as email and password (premium account)
     - Three parts will be accepted just like two except the last part will be taken as username (which will be used to display the skin)
Same format is applied to .txt files that want to be imported with the file chooser
[] We made loading old configs compatible but it won't be possible for people with older versions load Remix 1.7+ files
[] Vanilla speed slider applies to Mineplex speed. Its a speed cap, mineplex speed increases over time
[] Account manager keyboard support:
	- If an account is selected:
		> While having left shift pressed you can move the selected account up and down in the list by using the arrows
		> Login by pressing return/enter or delete it by pressing back/delete
	- If a text box is selected:
		> By pressing return/enter you can add the content as a cracked/premium account (depends on the content)
		> By pressing tab you can switch to the next text box
[] In the account manager if you press "Direct" and have an account on your clipboard it will be login with it
[] Manually changing the login service type is no longer needed, if the email contains "@alt.com" it will auto login by using TheAltening


[11/10/2020 - Re-release 1.7.0 additions]
- Improved panel type click gui to adapt between different gui scales (previously only working as intended in Normal)

- Added PacketAmount option to FastBow module
- Added BlinkMode (Stay, Pulse and Damage) option to Flight module

- Fixed not taking damage when having both blink and damage options enabled until it finished blinking

Notes:
[] In the account manager, if you type email:password in the email/username text box and press the Add/Direct buttton
it will parse the account automatically. Previously this feature only worked with clipboard while the text boxes are empty.
Don't forget that text boxes have priority over clipboard for the "Direct" button function.
